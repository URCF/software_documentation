**MEGAHIT 1.0.6-hotfix1** is a NGS de novo assembler for assembling
large and complex metagenomics data in a time- and cost-efficient
manner. It finished assembling a soil metagenomics dataset with 252 Gbps
in 44.1 and 99.6 h on a single computing node with and without a
graphics processing unit, respectively.[1][2]
