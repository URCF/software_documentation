**Salmon** is a tool for quantifying the expression of transcripts using
RNA-seq data. Salmon uses new algorithms (specifically, coupling the
concept of quasi-mapping with a two-phase inference procedure) to
provide accurate expression estimates very quickly (i.e. wicked-fast)
and while using little memory.[1][2]
