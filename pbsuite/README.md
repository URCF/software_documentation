**PBSuite** contains PBJelly (a genome upgrading tool), and PBHoney (a
structural variation discovery tool).[1]

Installed Version
-----------------

Version **15.2.20** is installed on Proteus. It uses
[BLASR](/Compiling_BLASR "wikilink") 1.3.1. To use, load the module

`    pbsuite/15.2.20`

Note:

-   this uses Python 2.7.9
-   this also sets the PYTHONPATH environment variable, which may break
    Python for you (i.e. Python modules may not be found, the wrong
    version of modules may be loaded, etc)
