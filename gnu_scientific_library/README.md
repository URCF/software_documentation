**GNU Scientific Library** (GSL) is a numerical library for C and C++
programmers.[1]

Installed Versions
------------------

### Default Red Hat-provided Version

Red Hat Enterprise Linux comes with GSL 1.13. It can be used without any
additional configuration.

### Locally-Compiled Version

A locally-compiled version 2.2.1 is also available. Use the modulefile:

`    gsl/gcc/2.2.1`

To use this version, rpath[2][3] will need to be used to override the
default Red Hat-provided version.
